## Portfolio WIP for Masters Submissions/General Use
Creating a website portfolio from scratch to show web dev skill. 

## To Do:
- Add LinkedIn to Menu
- Add bottom cloud border to menu tab
- Rename/reframe portfolio games (longer descriptions with highlighting of skills and renaming repos to less focus on class)
- Link github repos 
- Show engineering skills (very project forward rn) -> maybe have a design side and an engineering side 
- Show off engineering specific skills (knowledge of Github, copilot (agentic coding tools), refactoring)

# Tech Known - Little bubbles with hover strat 
Can do list or can do what I say online somewhere - bubbles with the image of the tech in there and hovering over it pulls up a text box with what it is -> like angular icon in a bubble with a hover popup that says Angular

# Project Page Styling
Will people even look at this if I have a featured section on the main page? 

# Project Page Update 
Currently has two projects - try to get up to at least 10 

# ???
Style tech list, update tech list (?), update floating flowers for other screen sizes so they don't go above about me div, update menu bar to actually work with contact info (email, linkedin, resume, project page once that's ready?), overall responsiveness check for styling
